# NSIS 3.03 Add-ons #
This folder contains the necessary files for NSIS add-ons and for configuring the
appropriate development environment for developing TSTool and building a windows
installer for the program. After downloading and installing [NSIS 3.03](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/),
the files/folders found in this directory should be copied into the corresponding
folders and sub-folders under `C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS`.

For more information on these specific files and how to add them to NSIS 3.03 see
the online documentation [here](http://localhost:8001/dev-env/nsis/#nsis-add-ons-for-nsis-303).
